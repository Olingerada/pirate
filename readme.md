# Pirate

Command line HTML parser/scraper used for grabbing torrents from [ThePirateBay](https://thepiratebay.se).

Initially made for the older version with torrents hosted from a separate subdomain, but now modified for grabbing magnet links instead.

----

## Usage

Place the script somewhere in your executable path. I like ~/bin

```
$ mkdir ~/bin
$ echo 'PATH=$PATH:~/bin' > .bashrc
```

Then just run it

```
$ pirate.py
```

The rest is self explanatory
